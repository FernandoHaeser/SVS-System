# Single Vaccination System
the Unified Vaccination System (SVS) was made so that clients/patients of a certain institution (Hospitals, Health Centers, Clinics, etc.) can have access to their vaccination data. And for the operators (doctors, nurses, etc.), it offers better control for the vaccination control of the patients of the institution.
